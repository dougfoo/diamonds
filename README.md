Diamond Pricing and Analysis App

Playing w/ React Victory Charts and Flask -- GUI for backend Flask aggregator of pricing estimators
across Azure, Scikit, etc.  Live site:  https://diamonds.azurewebsites.net/   Data is scraped from bluenile (thanks BN)

Goal
- Learn bit more Flask
- Learn how to use Azure's various ML libraries 
- Learn more Azure pipelines CI/CD (which sucks)
- Learn some React-Victor charting
- Learn MongoDB basic API
- Learn web scraping fun (not fun)

Longer term
- Store historical data on a regular interval/poll of diamond data (which they will probably keep changing to mess me up)
